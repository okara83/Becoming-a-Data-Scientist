Hence, in different iterations of training, we will drop out a different set of neurons.\n\nThis way we prevent the weight from being overly dependent on eachother: for example for one weight to be unnecessarily large to compensate for another unnecessarily large weight with the opposite sign. In other words, weights are encouraged to be *strong and independent*.\n<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*iWQzxhVlvadk6VAJjsgXgg.png' width=400>\n\n\n### 7.3.2 Layer Optimization\nOur `MNISTClassifier()` had until now 3 layers with a fixed number on neurons in each layer. We can change that by making it changable during training, so eventually we can apply `Grid Search` and find the best combination possible.\n\n### 7.3.3 Changing the Structure of our MNISTClassifier()\nNow let's change our Neural Net a bit:\n* `nn.Dropout(p=0.4)`: each neuron has 40% chance of being dropped\n* `layer1_size`: size of the first hidden layer\n* `layer2_size`: size of the second hidden layer","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class MNIST_Classifier_Improved(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, layer1_size=50, layer2_size=20, dropout=0.4):    #structure of FNN\n        super(MNIST_Classifier_Improved, self).__init__()\n        \n        self.layers = nn.Sequential(nn.Dropout(p= dropout),       #dropout for first layer\n                      nn.Linear(28*28, layer1_size),              # 784 neurons to 50\n                      nn.ReLU(),                                  # activation functino\n                      nn.Dropout(p=dropout),                      # Dropout for second layer\n                      nn.Linear(layer1_size, layer2_size),        # Second layer: 50 neurons to 20\n                      nn.ReLU(),                                  # activation function\n                      nn.Dropout(p=dropout),                      # dropout for output layer\n                      nn.Linear(layer2_size, 10))                 # output layer\n         \n    def forward(self, image):              # taking image through NN                       \n        image= image.view(-1, 28*28)       # Flatten image (Matrix to Vector)\n        out = self.layers(image)           #  log probabilities output\n        \n        return out","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-28T08:41:13.03411Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-28T08:41:13.034448Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-28T08:41:13.040832Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-28T08:41:13.034418Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-28T08:41:13.039762Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Improved Model Structure:\n<img src='https://i.imgur.com/m22zEqN.png' width='600'>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Training Improved model now:\nmodel_improved = MNIST_Classifier_Improved(layer1_size=80, layer2_size=50, dropout=0.5)\nprint(model_improved,\"\\n\")\n\ntrain_network(model_improved, mnist_train, mnist_test,num_epochs=220,learning_rate=0.001,weight_decay=0.0005)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-28T08:44:44.622735Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-28T08:44:44.623083Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-28T08:47:43.823628Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-28T08:44:44.623053Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-28T08:47:43.822344Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"get_accuracy(model_improved, mnist_train,64)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-28T08:50:35.237559Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-28T08:50:35.238005Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-28T08:50:35.254833Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-28T08:50:35.237977Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-28T08:50:35.253777Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 8.
