    "\n",
    "Julia has many interesting features, but here is a small sample of what I think is most basic characteristics that make Julia attractive for Science and Engineering.\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>JIT Compiled. Write code that looks interpreted, and yet it gets to run as just as fast as compiled code. No need to vectorize code for performance, devectorized code is fast</li> \n",
    "<li>Optionally Typed. Do some rapid prototyping with maximum flexibility, and then optimize for performance.</li> \n",
    "<li> Nice Mathematical Syntax. Builds upon and goes much further than classical mathematical languages like Fortran, Matlab, and Mathematica</li> \n",
    "<li>General purpose. Get code from the package manager to perform all sort of tasks, from reading multiple types of databases, to data visualization, or running an HTTP server </li> \n",
