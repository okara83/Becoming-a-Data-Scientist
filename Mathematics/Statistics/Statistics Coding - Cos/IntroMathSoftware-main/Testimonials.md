## Overview:
I am making this course material available in part so that I have something to add to my teaching portfolio. Accordingly, I have decided to add a few pieces of student feedback below. This feedback was collected as part of UC San Diego's CAPES; this is the university's way of collecting student feedback on courses and instructors at the end of the term. In total I had 54 students complete this survey anonymously. 

## Notes:
Any remarks on student feedback would not be complete without mentioning the following information: 
- I am a white male. Studies have shown that this will *positively bias* my evaluations, for no good reason. See, for instance, [Exploring Bias in Student Evaluations: Gender, Race, and Ethnicity](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/exploring-bias-in-student-evaluations-gender-race-and-ethnicity/91670F6003965C5646680D314CF02FA4). 
-  The class was taught in my native tongue (English). This also *positively biases* my evaluations. See, for instance, [The Influence of Instructor Native Language on Student Learning and Instructor Ratings](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40326049?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)
-  The class grades were *quite high* (88% of a student's grade in this class was based on homework, participation, and the final project; most students did the work, and their grades reflected that). The relationships of this with student evaluations is discussed here: [Do Higher Grades Lead to Favorable Student Evaluations?](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30042630?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)

I do think that there are concrete things that I did which led to the overall positive response to this class: I spent long hours preparing for most of the lectures and included participation checks to promote engagement and active learning; I encouraged and incorporated student feedback; I was responsive on the course chatroom. But again, to ignore the listed facts would not be painting the full picture. 

Finally, there is always the question of whether or not I am cherry picking to select only the favorable reviews. I have attached the complete report in the Logistics/capes.pdf file for full disclosure.

## General Student Feedback on the Course:
"Such a cool class to take, I can't believe I had never considered it before. I learned a little about
a lot of things and it was really fun! Coding is typically not very intuitive for me but I feel a lot
more comfortable with it now. I didn't even feel like I was taking this for my major at many
points and just for fun because it was such a chill and interesting class!"

"Cannot recommend this class and the material enough. Very underrated since it has things any
science or math undergrad needs to know. Even if you know python you should still take it, but
it covers all the basic to make sure you know how to work with python. If you already know
things in this class, you still won't find your time "wasted" you'll still learn alot!"

"I think this course is a very interesting one because it blends together concepts of math and
computer science. It shows that the two subjects can be used hand in hand in a real life setting
which is particularly useful for my major."

"Extremely interesting course. I had no idea what this course would be like. As a math-cs major,
it was very refreshing to learn how mathematics and cs come together. I learned a lot of useful
concepts and applications. I learned how to use my knowledge in both and relate them to each
other. I really liked that this course was interactive. To me, I think that it is better and easier to
follow along with the lecture via remote learning. I don't know how this class is taught in person,
but the participation checks and having the lecture open to follow along was very helpful. It was
much easier to see what exactly the professor was doing on his screen. I liked that we had the
ability to play around on our own files."

## Student Feedback Specific to the Instructor:

"The instructor is receptive to student feedback. I admire the instructor taking the time to
address student feedback on the Zulip chat and Google Form surveys. He is also approachable
and accommodating during his Office Hours. Furthermore, he is very accessible even outside
lecture times, and I can find help if I ask. Lastly, I like that Thomas always connected the theory
to real-world examples. I learned a lot from this course, and I also had a lot of fun."

"He's a great professor. He's willing to take advice from students and integrate them into the
classroom."

"I really appreciate your flexibility while teaching this course. I understand it is really hard to
teach something online as opposed to in person, but I believe that you did an exceptional job.
The lectures were easy to follow and the homework accordingly so."

"He's a really great professor! Very chill and always knows what he's talking about but not in a
condescending way. Sometimes I almost felt like he is a peer and it was a nice experience to
have such an understanding professor of how the students learn and feel."

"Thomas Grubb created an environment where everyone was coming to class excited to see what
we were going to learn by being enthusiastic and interested in what he was talking about. He
connected mostly everything that seemed abstract to something real and concrete and it made
the class feel more inviting to someone who may be confused about how everything works."
